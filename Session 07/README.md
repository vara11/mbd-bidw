## Main Concepts

  - What is data integration
  - What is ETL
  - ETL subsystems

## How to use this content

  - Watch the videos
  - Download the folder
  - If you want to reproduce download the dataset (customer_data.csv) and install the programs
  - Required Software:
    - JDK v8
    - Pentaho Data Integration (latest version)
  
## What you can learn in the videos

  - [PDI - Our First ETL](https://vimeo.com/234685308)

## FAQ

### Why is PDI not working?

Many reasons:

 - Your computer has JRE not JDK
 - Your computer has JDK v8 not v9
 - Your computer has several java virtual machines (7, 8 and/or 9).
 - PDI is not in the right folder
 - PDI has not been extracted from the zip file.
 
### How to solve the problem

Move PDI to the right location:

  - [Mac]: In the applications folder
  - [Windows]: In C:/

We must uninstall all JRE, JDK from our system and install the right JDK version.

[Windows]

  - Go to control panel > Uninstall programs. Delete all JRE and JDK not required. You have more information [here](https://java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_java.xml)
  - Download Java SE Development Kit 8u172 from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
  - Install JAVA following the steps of the installer.

[Mac]

  - Uninstall Java. Open the terminal and execute:

``` 
sudo rm -fr /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin
sudo rm -fr /Library/PreferencePanes/JavaControlPanel.prefpane
sudo rm -fr ~/Library/Application\ Support/Java
cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
sudo rm -rf jdk*
``` 

  - Download Java SE Development Kit 8u162 from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
  - Install JAVA following the steps of the installer.

### Are there other open source data integration options?

Yes, many and the amount is growing. Some of them:

 - [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org): an open source Java integration framework that enables integration of different applications using multiple protocols and technologies. It is a rule-based routing and mediation engine.
 - [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org): an open source platform written in Scala and Java. It provides a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for managing real-time data.
 - [Heka](http://hekad.readthedocs.io): an open source software system for high performance data gathering, analysis, monitoring and reporting. Its main component is a daemon program known as ‘hekad’ that enables the functionality of gathering, converting, evaluating, processing and delivering data.
 - [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash): an open source data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforming the source data and store events into ElasticSearch by default. Logstash is part of an ELK stack.
 - [Pentaho Data Integration](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/): an open source java ETL tool that supports multiple data integration steps. 
 - [Talend Open Studio](https://www.talend.com/products/talend-open-studio/): products provide tools to integrate, cleanse, mask and profile data. Talend has a GUI that enables managing a large number of source systems using standard connectors.
 - [Singer](https://www.singer.io): is an open-source standard for writing scripts that move data.
 
And many more proprietary options: [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com), [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com), [Improvado](http://improvado.io), [Flydata](https://www.flydata.com), [Alooma](https://www.alooma.com), [Blendo](https://www.blendo.co) or [Segment](https://segment.com), [etleap](https://etleap.com), [CloverETL](http://www.cloveretl.com) among many others.
